# ✅ Tracklist – Immutable Daily Productivity Checklist (Solidity Project)

Tracklist is a beginner-friendly Web3 project built using **Solidity**.  
It allows users to maintain a **daily productivity checklist on-chain**, ensuring transparency and immutability — once a task is created, it **cannot be altered or deleted**, reinforcing accountability and consistency.

---

## 📌 Project Description

Tracklist is a decentralized application (dApp) that enables users to create and mark tasks as completed on the blockchain. Unlike traditional to-do list apps that store data in centralized databases, Tracklist ensures that once a task is added, it becomes **permanent**, leveraging Ethereum blockchain immutability.

This is especially helpful for productivity and habit-building — no cheating, no editing the past. Every task and completion status becomes a timestamped proof stored on-chain.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Users can **add daily tasks** to their checklist.
- Users can **mark tasks as completed**.
- All tasks are **public and immutable**, stored permanently on the blockchain.
- Perfect for accountability-based productivity systems.

No more "I’ll delete this task—no one will know."  
With Tracklist, **the blockchain knows**. 😄
